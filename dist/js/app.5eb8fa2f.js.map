<ul> <li><strong>Fast:</strong> KaTeX renders its math synchronously and doesn&#39;t need to reflow the page. See how it compares to a competitor in <a href=\\\"http://www.intmath.com/cg5/katex-mathjax-comparison.php\\\">this speed test</a>.</li> <li><strong>Print quality:</strong> KaTeX&#39;s layout is based on Donald Knuth&#39;s TeX, the gold standard for math typesetting.</li> <li><strong>Self contained:</strong> KaTeX has no dependencies and can easily be bundled with your website resources.</li> <li><strong>Server side rendering:</strong> KaTeX produces the same output regardless of browser or environment, so you can pre-render expressions using Node.js and send them as plain HTML.</li> </ul> <p>KaTeX is compatible with all major browsers, including Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Opera, Edge, and IE 9–11.</p> <p>KaTeX supports much (but not all) of LaTeX and many LaTeX packages. See the <a href=\\\"https://katex.org/docs/supported.html\\\">list of supported functions</a>.</p> <p>Try out KaTeX <a href=\\\"https://katex.org/#demo\\\">on the demo page</a>!</p> <h2 id=\\\"getting-started\\\">Getting started</h2> <h3 id=\\\"starter-template\\\">Starter template</h3> <pre><code class=\\\"language-html\\\">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\\n&lt;!-- KaTeX requires the use of the HTML5 doctype.

For example:</p> <pre><code class=\\\"language-js\\\">katex.render(&quot;c = \\\\\\\\pm\\\\\\\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}&quot;, element, {\\n    throwOnError: false\\n});</code></pre> <p>Call <code>katex.renderToString</code> to generate an HTML string of the rendered math, e.g., for server-side rendering. For example:</p> <pre><code class=\\\"language-js\\\">var html = katex.renderToString(&quot;c = \\\\\\\\pm\\\\\\\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}&quot;, {\\n    throwOnError: false\\n});\\n// &#39;&lt;span class=&quot;katex&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&#39;</code></pre> <p>Make sure to include the CSS and font files in both cases. If you are doing all rendering on the server, there is no need to include the JavaScript on the client.</p> <p>The examples above use the <code>throwOnError: false</code> option, which renders invalid inputs as the TeX source code in red (by default), with the error message as hover text. For other available options, see the <a href=\\\"https://katex.org/docs/api.html\\\">API documentation</a>, <a href=\\\"https://katex.org/docs/options.html\\\">options documentation</a>, and <a

`alias`：枚举项在业务中的别名，通常使用大写字母和下划线组成的常量表达方式\n   * - `text`：该项显示时的文字\n   *\n   * 使用本类，可以简单地创建一个枚举对象，如：\n   *\n   *     var Status = new Enum(\n   *         { alias: 'NORMAL', text: '正常' },\n   *         {
